                    Heuristics and search algorithms are the two key components
                    of heuristic search, one of the main approaches to many
                    variations of domain-independent planning, including
                    classical planning, temporal planning, planning under
                    uncertainty and adversarial planning. This workshop seeks to
                    understand the underlying principles of current heuristics
                    and search methods, their limitations, ways for overcoming
                    those limitations, as well as the synergy between heuristics
                    and search.

                  <h3>Keynote Speaker</h3>

                  The HSDIP workshop is proud to announce that
                  <b>Shirin Sohrabi</b>
                  will be a keynote speaker for this year’s workshop. Shirin is
                  a research staff member and research manager at IBM T.J.
                  Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. Her
                  research interests are in the area of Artificial Intelligence
                  (AI) with a focus on AI planning and its many applications. In
                  particular, she is interested in knowledge engineering and
                  modeling issues for AI planning, planning with incomplete
                  knowledge, planning with preferences, temporal planning,
                  cost-sensitive planning, diverse planning, as well as
                  combining AI planning and reinforcement learning.

                  <h3>Topics and Objectives</h3>

                  <p>
                    Search guided by heuristics, automatically derived from a
                    declarative formulation of action effects, preconditions and
                    goals, has been a successful approach to domain-independent
                    planning. From the initial success of heuristics based on
                    syntactic relaxations and abstractions, the theory and
                    practice of developing novel heuristics have become more
                    diverse, often borrowing concepts and tools from
                    Optimisation and Satisfiability, and bolder, tackling more
                    expressive planning languages.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In parallel to the increasing maturity of the methods and
                    tools used to derive heuristic methods, important
                    theoretical results have brought around a more clear image
                    of how heuristic methods relate to each other. For instance,
                    it has been shown that classic frameworks for heuristic
                    search as planning can be encoded symbolically and their
                    execution simulated via off-the-shelf satisfiability
                    solvers. Groundbreaking theoretical work has shown how
                    heuristic methods can be grouped into distinct families,
                    depending on whether they can or cannot be shown to dominate
                    or be compiled into each other.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As a result, the formulation of heuristics for
                    domain-independent planning is increasingly being less about
                    describing procedures that exploit specific features in
                    declarative information, and more about describing auxiliary
                    constraints that make apparent those features to
                    off-the-shelf solvers that operate over a logical or
                    algebraic theory that over-approximate the set of valid
                    plans and compute the heuristic estimator.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Last, but not least, there is a growing realization that the
                    search algorithm used can significantly amplify or reduce
                    the utility of specific heuristics. Recent work that
                    highlights the pitfalls latent in well-known search
                    algorithms, also suggests opportunities to exploit synergies
                    between the heuristic calculation and the search control.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The workshop on Heuristics and Search for Domain-Independent
                    Planning (HSDIP) is the 13th workshop in a series that
                    started with the "Heuristics for Domain-Independent
                    Planning" (HDIP) workshops at ICAPS 2007. At ICAPS 2012, the
                    workshop was changed to its current name and scope to
                    explicitly encourage work on search for domain-independent
                    planning.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Examples of typical topics for submissions to this workshop
                    are:
                  </p>

                      novel heuristic methods dealing with planning with numeric
                      variables and effects, partial observability and
                      non-deterministic action effects
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      heuristic estimators for domain-independent planning via
                      procedures or suitably defined encodings of declarative
                      descriptions of planning tasks into Satisfiability or
                      Optimisation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      novel search techniques for domain-independent planning
                      that explicitly aim at exploiting effectively the
                      properties of existing heuristics
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      empirical observations of synergies between heuristics and
                      search in domain-independent planning
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      challenging domains for existing combinations of
                      heuristics and search algorithms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      applications of machine learning in heuristic search,
                      e.g., learning heuristics, adaptive search strategies, or
                      heuristic selection.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    The HSDIP workshop has always been welcoming of
                    multidisciplinary work, for example, drawing inspiration
                    from operations research (like row and column generation
                    algorithms), convex optimization (like gradient optimization
                    for hybrid planning), constraint programming, or
                    satisfiability.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and
                    we encourage papers that report on work in progress or that
                    do not fit the mold of a typical conference paper.
                    Non-trivial negative results are welcome to the workshop,
                    but we expect the authors to argue for the significance of
                    the presented results.
                  </p>

                    and technical quality. There will be a brief discussion
                    phase where author and reviewers can interactively engage
                    and discuss the submission and the reviews.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Submissions sent to other conferences are allowed. It is the
                    responsibility of the authors to ensure that those venues
                    allow for papers submitted to be already published in
                    "informal" ways (e.g. on proceedings or websites without
                    associated ISSN/ISBN). In particular, we welcome submissions
                    sent to the IJCAI conference and made sure that the workshop
                    discussion phase does not conflict with the IJCAI rebuttal
                    phase.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the
                    workshop in order to present the paper. The workshop format
                    (fully virtual or hybrid) will be the same as the format of
                    the main conference. Authors must register for the ICAPS
                    conference in order to attend the workshop.
                  </p>
